# INSUREWISE
InsureWise is a smart, AI-based chatbot designed to help users find the most suitable insurance options based on their needs. Built with a Django backend and a frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite, the project integrates LangChain and Gemini Pro LLMs to deliver intelligent recommendations. Web scraping via BeautifulSoup is used to collect real-time insurance data from Nepali insurance websites. This collaborative student project focuses on making insurance more accessible and understandable through natural language interaction.
